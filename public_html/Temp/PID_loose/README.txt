This directory contains the plots of reconstructed B+ decays placing looser cuts on B -> ppK decay. 
The reduced chi square tolerance condition is applied to the B+ vertex.

The directory NoRedChi2Cuts contains files for which the B+ vertex reduced chi squared thresold acceptance 
is set to 5 (as the original scripts). This illustrates, by comparison, how this factor is most effective 
to disciriminate between the two regimes (compare the plots including the gamma).
